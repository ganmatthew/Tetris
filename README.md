## Tetris
This app is a mobile port of Tetris, the popular game from the NES system. 

The application will feature a 10x20 playing field with three modes of gameplay: 

 - A “sprint” where the player aims to clear 40 lines as fast as possible;
 - A “marathon” where the player tries to score as much as possible within the given time, and;
 - An “endless” mode where there are no time limits nor scores, and the player can enjoy unlimited time playing or practicing the game.
 
Game progress is saved when the player exits, and the saved state is loaded when resuming in this mode. Options will also be given for the player to adjust touch sensitivity and sounds.

### Controls
 - *Move:* **Drag the falling Tetris pieces left and right** to move them around the grid.
 - *Accelerate:* **Swipe down Tetris pieces** to make them incrementally fall down faster.
 - *Hold:* **Swipe up Tetris pieces** to move them into a hold storage, which can store one piece at a time.
 - *Rotate:* **Tap the left side** of the screen to rotate the current piece counterclockwise, or **tap the right side** of the screen to rotate the current piece clockwise.
